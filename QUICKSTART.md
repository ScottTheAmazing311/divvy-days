## Your First Playthrough

### Goal: Get the Perfect Week Ending (Ending 10)

To unlock the best ending, you need:
- ✅ **5+ Friends** (Attempting status or better)

  1. Participate in Day 2 All-Hands Meeting (support or oppose)
  2. Join the Friday 7-11 Walk (Day 5)

### Key Choices for Success

**Day 1:**
- Wave at everyone in the lobby (+5 to 3 characters)
- Chat with Jordan when offered
- Join Jordan for lunch (major relationship boost)
- Share ideas in the afternoon meeting (impresses Andre & Jordan)

**Day 2:**
- Take the coffee break to meet Skylar
- **CRITICAL**: Speak up in the All-Hands meeting (support or oppose - either works)
- Have lunch with coworkers (not solo)
- Be honest with Harper at the end of day

**Day 3:**
- Accept Alex's help with analytics
- Join Ramona for sushi lunch
- Stay late with the team (important for relationships)

**Day 4:**
- Accept excited for your first project
- Collaborate with Jordan on the marketing copy
- Have lunch with Andre (deepens friendship)

**Day 5:**

- **CRITICAL**: Join the 7-11 walk when invited

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Working through lunch every day (you miss social opportunities)
❌ Staying quiet in the All-Hands meeting (miss core experience)
❌ Declining the 7-11 walk (miss core experience)
❌ Being rude or dismissive to anyone (burns bridges)
❌ Using Slack too much instead of in-person interactions
❌ Going home early on Day 3 (miss bonding opportunity)

## Relationship Tips

- Each character needs **40+ points** to reach "Attempting" status
- Positive choices typically give +5 to +10 points
- Negative choices can cost -5 to -10 points
- You need 5 characters at "Attempting" or better for top endings
- Focus on: Andre, Jordan, Woody, Ramona, and Colby (easiest to befriend)

## Speedrun Tips

If you want to quickly test endings:

1. **Perfect Ending**: Follow the guide above precisely
2. **Social Butterfly**: Accept all lunch invitations, skip some core experiences
3. **Loner Ending**: Decline all social invitations, work alone
4. **Bad Ending**: Be rude to everyone, skip all events, burn all bridges
