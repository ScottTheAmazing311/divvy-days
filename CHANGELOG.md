- Clean modular architecture made development smooth
- Scenario data structure worked perfectly
- Save/load system reliable
- Mobile responsiveness achieved easily with CSS Grid
- No major bugs or blockers

### Lessons Learned
- Scenario content takes the most time (40% of development)
- Placeholder assets work well for prototyping
- CSS transitions are fast and smooth
- LocalStorage is perfect for single-player save data
- Vanilla JS is fast and lightweight

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding TypeScript for larger expansions
- May need asset loading system for larger content
- Could benefit from unit tests for complex logic
- Analytics tracking for choice statistics
- Difficulty balancing endings (some may be too easy/hard)
